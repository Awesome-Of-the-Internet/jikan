Jikan is a PHP API with scrapes and parses requests from [MyAnimeList.net](https://myanimelist.net).

The raison d'être of Jikan is to help developers easily get the data they need for their apps and projects without having to depend on the lackluster official API, unstable APIs, or sidetracking their projects to develop parsers.

The word _Jikan_ literally translates to _Time_ in Japanese (**時間**). And that's what this API saves you of. ;)

## Getting Started
1. `composer require jikan-me/jikan`
2. [Documentation](http://docs.jikan.moe)

:exclamation: If you are using `dev-master` and are not ready for v2 yet, require version `~1.0` until you are.

#### Dependencies
- [Goutte](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/Goutte)
- PHP 7.1+

## Jikan REST API
There's a REST service available, as well as a few wrappers built around it.
